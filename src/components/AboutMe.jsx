        Hi! My name is Tyler Whitchurch. Iâ€™m specializing in Full-Stack Web
        Development and currently in my third trimester at Atlas School. My
        favorite technologies to work with are Python, JavaScript, and React.  
        After school, I want to pursue a career as a software engineer, working
        on impactful applications that solve real problems. Outside of coding,
        I enjoy golf, gaming, and working on cars.
      </p>
